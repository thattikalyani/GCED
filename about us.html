<h2>GCED — Our Theory of Change</h2><br>
<p1>A theory of change explains how change happens, and how interventions can shape that change. <br>

 

Our theory of change is based on five outcomes that are interlinked and underpins the delivery of our GCED strategy, initiatives, and interventions. It sets out how we develop propositions that improve the efficacy of our interventions, generate evidence and build capacity in order to drive change in policy and practice.<br>

​

Our Theory of Change has three elements:<br>

<h4><b>THE INNOVATION MINDSET</b></h4><br> 
What we mean when we talk about innovating.<br> 

<i>Think Big.<br> 
Start Small.</i><br> 
It is all about thinking big, keeping the goal small, the team tight and the timeline short.<br> 

<i>Reflective Action</i><br> 
Don’t overthink it,<br> 
just try it. But when you try, reflect on the impact and how you could be more innovative!<br> 

<i>Fail Forward and Excel</i><br> 
Foster open-mindedness and a growth mindset. Use your setbacks to fuel future success. If you're not prepared to fail forward, it will be hard to come up with anything original.<br> 

<i>Celebrate Small Wins</i><br> 
Celebrating small wins is essential to make big changes and bigger impact!</p2><br>
